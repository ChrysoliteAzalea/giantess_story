## Chapter 1

In a nice and sunny summer day a gorgeous light-brown skinned elven woman Fragrance came back from her work. She was living in her own one-room apartment at the third floor of the house. In her apartment, her tiny human friend Anwyll were waiting for her.

Anwyll was a 15 year old human boy, who was transferred to Fragrance's world by unknown means. During transfer, he got shrunk to the size of 10 cm tall, after transfer he was found by Fragrance and brought to her apartment.

"Hi, Anwyll!", said Fragrance to her tiny friend.
"Hello, Fragrance!"
"How are you?"
"Fine, thank you"
"I'm fine too. I have finished my work project and I'm taking a vacation which starts tomorrow."
"That's great!"

Fragrance went to bathroom and changed to her home clothes. After that she went to her bedroom, took Anwyll and laid on her bed, putting Anwyll on her pillow.

"Excuse me, Fragrance. I would like to know, is there any way to enlarge me or return me to my world?", Anwyll asked his friend.
"Sorry, Anwyll, but we don't currently know why do people get here from another worlds and why some of them change size in process. I don't even know from which world you are".
"Alright. Sometimes I hate being so small. I can't go anywhere without you. I can't even go anywhere inside your house. I can't go to meet anyone or make friends."
"Yeah, I feel for you", Fragrance said, and then took Anwyll and gave him a kiss.
"Anwyll, I have something to tell you. Today I am having a slumber party with my friends, Inessa and Radiance. Do you want to join us?", Fragrance asked her friend.
"Of course I do!", Anwyll said joyfully.
