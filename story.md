## Chapter 1

In a nice and sunny summer day a gorgeous light-brown skinned elven woman Fragrance came back from her work. She was living in her own one-room apartment at the third floor of the house. In her apartment, her tiny human friend Anwyll were waiting for her.


Anwyll was a 15 year old human boy, who was transferred to Fragrance's world by unknown means. During transfer, he got shrunk to the size of 10 cm tall, after transfer he was found by Fragrance and brought to her apartment.


"Hi, Anwyll!", Fragrance said to her tiny friend.

"Hello, Fragrance!"

"How are you?"

"Fine, thank you"

"I'm fine too. I have finished my work project and I'm taking a vacation which starts tomorrow."

"That's great!"


Fragrance went to bathroom and changed to her home clothes. After that she went to her bedroom, took Anwyll and laid on her bed, putting Anwyll on her pillow.


"Excuse me, Fragrance. I would like to know, is there any way to enlarge me or return me to my world?", Anwyll asked his friend.

"Sorry, Anwyll, but we don't currently know why do people get here from another worlds and why some of them change size in process. I don't even know from which world you are".

"Alright. Sometimes I hate being so small. I can't go anywhere without you. I can't even go anywhere inside your house. I can't go to meet anyone or make friends."

"Yeah, I feel for you", Fragrance said, and then took Anwyll and gave him a kiss.

"Anwyll, I have something to tell you. Today I am having a slumber party with my friends, Inessa and Radiance. Do you want to join us?", Fragrance asked her friend.

"Of course I do!", Anwyll said joyfully.


Later, at the evening, when Fragrance was cooking supper and Anwyll was sitting at the table in the bedroom looking at Fragrance's photos, the door bell rang. Fragrance opened the door and saw Radiance and Inessa coming in. Radiance was light-blue-skinned elven woman and Inessa was a 11 cm tall faerie.


"Hello, Fragrance! How are you?"

"Hello, Radiance! Hello, Inessa! I'm fine, thank you! How are you?"

"I'm fine!", Inessa said.

"I'm fine too", Radiance said.

"Fragrance, is that tiny human boy you told us about here? Can we see him?", Inessa asked.

"Of course you can! He is there, in my living room.", Fragrance responded.

Radiance, Fragrance and Inessa went into the living room to the table Anwyll was staying on.

"Introduce yourself, please.", Fragrance asked her friends.

"I'm Radiance, a Fragrance's childhood friend. I'm a 350 year old sky elf, currently working as senior developer at the 'Heaven Lilies' company. I frequently visit Fragrance during my vacations."

"Nice to meet you, Radiance! Thank you for coming.", Anwyll responded.

"I'm Inessa, a 214 year old faerie. I made friends with Fragrance and Radiance seventy years ago. I have lots of friends in this town.", Inessa introduced herself.

"Nice to meet you, Inessa. Thank you for coming. And I'm Anwyll. I'm 15 years old, I was transported to this world two weeks ago. Fragrance found me and took me to her home. I was a school student in my world.", Anwyll introduced himself.

"Nice to meet you"


Fragrance, Radiance, Anwyll and Inessa came to the kitchen and had a supper. After the meal, Fragrance and Radiance changed their home clothes to cute pajamas.

"Hey, Anwyll! I have made this pajama for you. Would you like to try it on?", Fragrance asked.

"Yes, surely".

Anwyll hid behind the doll house and changed his clothes to pajama that Fragrance has made for him.

"Wow, you look very cute in this pajama!", Radiance said to Anwyll.

Soon, the slumber party started. Anwyll had fun with his new friends. They had snacks, played games, listened to the music. Before going to bed, they decided to watch a movie. Anwyll was sitting on Radiance, and Inessa was sitting near him.

"Thank you for visiting me! I'm very glad to meet you! And thank you, Fragrance, for caring about me!", Anwyll said.

"You're welcome, Anwyll!", Fragrance responded.

Anwyll felt asleep during the movie. He was glad to make friends in the giant world that was foreign to him.
