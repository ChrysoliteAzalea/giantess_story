# A new world for a tiny boy

## Prologue

It was an ordinary summer day when a 15 years old boy called Anwyll was walking in a city park. It was nearly 8 p.m. when he heard a strange sound, that was like the sound of an explosion, but at the same time was noticeably different from it. The sky turned dark-red and then dark-purple, the air gained a strange smell, and the sight of the environment became blurry. That's the last thing Anwyll remembered before waking up in another, strange, different world.


It was morning when Anwyll woke up. He has found himself on what seemed to be a huge bench. He was surrounded by giant grass several times taller than him, by bushes and blooming flowers at the height of his face. The bench was huge for him, and even if he managed to get to the ground unharmed, he couldn't go to any significant distance due to his size. Anwyll took the sandwich that he prepared before going for a walk for a light meal.


"Hello! Who are you?", said the unfamiliar voice. Anwyll looked up and saw a gorgeous light-brown skinned elven woman looking at the bench.

"My name is Anwyll. I was going for a walk when I heard a strange noise. Then I woke up here. Could you please help me? I don't know anyone here."

"Sure. My name is Fragrance. I can take you to my house and take care of you. Would you like to go with me?"

"Yes, sure!"

"Alright."

Fragrance took him and put him on her shoulder, wrapping her hair around him.

"Thank you, Fragrance! Thank you so much!"

## Chapter 1 -- The Slumber Party

In a nice and sunny summer day Fragrance came back from her work. She was living in her own one-room apartment at the third floor of the house. In her apartment, Anwyll were waiting for her.


"Hi, Anwyll!", Fragrance said to her tiny friend.

"Hello, Fragrance!"

"How are you?"

"Fine, thank you"

"I'm fine too. I have finished my work project and I'm taking a vacation which starts tomorrow."

"That's great!"


Fragrance went to bathroom and changed to her home clothes. After that she went to her bedroom, took Anwyll and laid on her bed, putting Anwyll on her pillow.


"Excuse me, Fragrance. I would like to know, is there any way to enlarge me or return me to my world?", Anwyll asked his friend.

"Sorry, Anwyll, but we don't currently know why do people get here from another worlds and why some of them change size in process. I don't even know from which world you are".

"Alright. Sometimes I hate being so small. I can't go anywhere without you. I can't even go anywhere inside your house. I can't go to meet anyone or make friends."

"Yeah, I feel for you", Fragrance said, and then took Anwyll and gave him a kiss.

"Anwyll, I have something to tell you. Today I am having a slumber party with my friends, Inessa and Radiance. Do you want to join us?"

"Of course I do!", Anwyll said joyfully.


Later, at the evening, when Fragrance was cooking supper and Anwyll was sitting at the table in the bedroom looking at Fragrance's photos, the door bell rang. Fragrance opened the door and saw Radiance and Inessa coming in. Radiance was light-blue-skinned elven woman and Inessa was a 11 cm tall faerie.


"Hello, Fragrance! How are you?"

"Hello, Radiance! Hello, Inessa! I'm fine, thank you! How are you?"

"I'm fine!", Inessa said.

"I'm fine too", Radiance said.

"Fragrance, is that tiny human boy you told us about here? Can we see him?", Inessa asked.

"Of course you can! He is there, in my living room."

Radiance, Fragrance and Inessa went into the living room to the table Anwyll was staying on.

"Introduce yourself, please.", Fragrance asked her friends.

"I'm Radiance, a Fragrance's childhood friend. I'm a 350 year old sky elf, currently working as senior developer at the 'Heaven Lilies' company. I frequently visit Fragrance during my vacations."

"Nice to meet you, Radiance! Thank you for coming.", Anwyll responded.

"I'm Inessa, a 214 year old faerie. I made friends with Fragrance and Radiance seventy years ago. I have lots of friends in this town."

"Nice to meet you, Inessa. Thank you for coming. And I'm Anwyll. I'm 15 years old, I was transported to this world two weeks ago. Fragrance found me and took me to her home. I was a school student in my world."

"Nice to meet you"


Fragrance, Radiance, Anwyll and Inessa came to the kitchen and had a supper. After the meal, Fragrance and Radiance changed their home clothes to cute pajamas.

"Hey, Anwyll! I have made this pajama for you. Would you like to try it on?", Fragrance asked.

"Yes, surely".

Anwyll hid behind the doll house and changed his clothes to pajama that Fragrance has made for him.

"Wow, you look very cute in this pajama!", Radiance said.

Soon, the slumber party started. Anwyll had fun with his new friends. They had snacks, played games, listened to the music. Before going to bed, they decided to watch a movie. Anwyll was sitting on Radiance, and Inessa was sitting near him.

"Thank you for visiting me! I'm very glad to meet you! And thank you, Fragrance, for caring about me!", Anwyll said.

"You're welcome, Anwyll!"

Anwyll felt asleep during the movie. He was glad to make friends in the giant world that was foreign to him.
